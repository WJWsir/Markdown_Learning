# Fenced Code Blocks

## 1) Creating code blocks in basic Markdow sytax

The basic Markdown syntax allows you to create code blocks by indenting lines by four spaces or one tab.

## 2) How to Creating fenced code blocks

- use three backticks (```) or three tildes (~~~) on the lines before and after the code block

eg.

```there can be no language to specify
<html>
    <head></head>
    <body>
        <p>How to create fenced code blocks</p>
        use three backticks (```) or three tildes (~~~) on the lines before and after the code block
    </body>
</html>
```

- ### Restriction

Whether or not I can create *fenced code blocks* depends on my Markdown processor or editor.

- ### Syntax Highlighting

>Many Markdown processors support syntax highlighting for fenced code blocks. This feature allows you to add color highlighting for whatever language your code was written in. To add syntax highlighting, specify a language next to the backticks before the fenced code block.

eg.

```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```

```html
<html>
    <head></head>
    <body>
        <p>How to highlight fenced code blocks</p>
        To add syntax highlighting, specify a language next to the backticks before the fenced code block.
    </body>
</html>
```
