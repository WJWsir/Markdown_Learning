# Using Emoji Shortcodes

## How to add emoji to Markdown files

There are two ways to add emoji to Markdown files:

1. copy and paste the emoji into your Markdown-formatted text.
2. type emoji shortcodes.

### 1) Copying and Pasting Emoji

- In most cases, you can simply copy an emoji from a source like [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) and paste it into your document.
- Many Markdown applications will automatically display the emoji in the Markdown-formatted text. The HTML and PDF files you export from your Markdown application should display the emoji.

Directly Copying and Pasting Emoji:

ðŸ˜€ Grinning Face
ðŸ™‚ Slightly Smiling Face
ðŸ™ƒ Upside-Down Face

> **Tip:** If you're using a static site generator, make sure you encode HTML pages as UTF-8.

### 2) Typing emoji shortcodes

- Some Markdown applications allow me to insert emoji by typing emoji shortcodes.
- These begin and end with a colon and include the name of an emoji.

```Markdown
Gone camping! :tent: Be back soon.

That is so funny! :joy:
```

Rendered output:

Gone camping! :tent: Be back soon.

That is so funny! :joy:

> **Note:** You can use [this list of emoji shortcodes](/EmojiShortCodes.md/#list-of-emoji-shortcode), but keep in mind that emoji shortcodes vary from application to application. Refer to your Markdown application's documentation for more information.
