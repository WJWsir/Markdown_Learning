# Definitoin Lists

## Restriction

Creating definition lists of terms and their corresponding definitions is allowed by **some Markdown processors**.

## How to create a definition list

1. Typing the term on the first line,
2. Typing a colon followed by a space and the definition.

eg.

### The definition list(description list)

First term
: This is the definition of the first term.

Second term
: This is one definition of the second term.
: This is another definition of the second term.

### The HTML looks like this

```html
<dl>
    <dt>First term</dt>
    <dd>This is the definition of the first term.</dd>

    <dt>Second term</dt>
    <dd>This is one definition of the second term.</dd>
    <dd>This is another definition of the second term.</dd>
</dl>
```

#### Definition Lists of Tags

`<dl>` tag
: defines the desciption list.

`<dt>` tag
: defines the data term.

`<dd>` tag
: defines the data decription.
